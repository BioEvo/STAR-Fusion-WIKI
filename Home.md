# STAR-Fusion 

STAR-Fusion uses the [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) aligner to identify candidate fusion transcripts supported by Illumina reads.  STAR-Fusion further processes the output generated by the STAR aligner to map junction reads and spanning reads to a reference annotation set.


## Installation

In addition to STAR-Fusion, the following tools and resource data sets must be installed:

### Tools Required:

*  STAR <https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR>
*  the following non-standard Perl modules from CPAN: Set/IntervalTree.pm and DB_File.pm
  
    A typical perl module installation may involve:
    perl -MCPAN -e shell
      install Set::IntervalTree
      install DB_File
 	
>The Set::IntervalTree module tends to install trouble-free on Linux.  Note, if you have trouble installing Set::IntervalTree on Mac OS X (as I did), try the following:  download the tarball from the http://search.cpan.org/~benbooth/Set-IntervalTree-0.02/lib/Set/IntervalTree.pm, run the perl Makefile.pl, then edit the generated 'Makefile' and remove all occurrences of '-arch i386'. Then try 'make', 'make test', and finally 'make install'.

### Data Resources Required:

A reference genome and corresponding protein-coding gene annotation set, including blast-matching gene pairs must be provided to STAR-Fusion.  We provide these resources for human fusion transcript detection using Hg19 and gencode.v19 annotations as [Hg19_CTAT_resource_lib.tar.gz](ftp://ftp.broadinstitute.org/pub/Trinity/CTAT_RESOURCE_LIB/Hg19_CTAT_resource_lib.tar.gz).  If you're looking to apply STAR-Fusion using a different target, you'll need to generate the required resources as described by our [FusionFilter](http://FusionFilter.github.io) resource builder.

Assuming the use of our Hg19_CTAT_resource_lib.tar.gz resource data set, build the various indexes required by STAR-Fusion like so:

     tar xvf Hg19_CTAT_resource_lib.tar.gz

     cd Hg19_CTAT_resource_lib/

     $STAR_FUSION_HOME/FusionFilter/prep_genome_lib.pl \
                             --genome_fa ref_genome.fa \
                             --gtf ref_annot.gtf \
                             --blast_pairs blast_pairs.outfmt6.gz


Once the build process completes successfully, you can then refer to the above like so with STAR-Fusion:

       STAR-Fusion --genome_lib_dir /path/to/your/Hg19_CTAT_resource_lib   ...

       # full usage info provided below.



## Running STAR-Fusion 

Given paired-end of FASTQ files, run STAR-Fusion like so:

     STAR-Fusion --genome_lib_dir /path/to/your/Hg19_CTAT_resource_lib \
                 --left_fq reads_1.fq \
                 --right_fq reads_2.fq \
                 

The output from STAR-Fusion is found as a tab-delimited file named 'star-fusion.fusion_candidates.final', and has the following format:

Note, these fusion candidates are derived based on mapping the STAR outputs to the reference annotations.  Paralogous genes are notorious for showing up as false-positive fusion candidates. Initial/preliminary predictions are found in file 'star-fusion.fusion_predictions.preliminary'. These are filtered using BLASTN, and those preliminary predictions that are excluded are prefixed with '#' in the file 'star-fusion.fusion_predictions.preliminary.filt', and the BLAST results are included in additional column fields for such entries.  Those that are not flagged as likely artifacts are reported in the final report file 'star-fusions.fusion_predictions.final'.  To turn off filtering (the BLAST step), simply run STAR-Fusion with the '--no_filter' parameter. See usage information (--help) for additional options).


## Parameterization 

STAR-Fusion will report all candidates having at least 1 junction read where the breakpoints match up precisely with reference exon junctions of two different genes.

For those breakpoints that do not precisely match at reference exon junctions, the breakpoint fusion read support must be at least --min_novel_junction_support (default 10 reads).

In the case where multiple candidate fusion breakpoints are reported, only those breakpoints having at least --min_alt_pct_junction (default 10%) of the dominant isoform junction support will be reported.

Finally, it is worth noting that the counts of spanning fragments are entirely non-overlapping with the counts of the breakpoint junction reads. That is, no spanning fragment (from Chimeric.out.sam) is counted if it contains a read that is reported as evidence in the breakpoint junction candidate data (from Chimeric.out.junction).



## Example data and execution:

In the included test/ directory, you'll find a 'runMe.sh' script along with a data/ subdirectory.  The data/ subdirectory contains example fusion and spanning data generated from running STAR, in addition to a reference annotation file for gencode v19. Note, the reference GTF file contains only the 'exon' records instead of all lines from the original gencode annotation file; this speeds up parsing of the file and keeps the file size relatively small for including in this package.

In this test/ directory, Run the sample execution like so:

    ./runMe.sh

which simply runs:

    ../STAR-Fusion -S Chimeric.out.sam.gz -J Chimeric.out.junction.gz 

and you'll find the output file 'star-fusion.fusion_candidates.txt' containing the fusion candidates in the format described above.


## Integrating alternative genome resources

STAR-Fusion comes with reference annotations and sequences based on the human reference genome Hg19 and gencode annotations.  

If you wish to use a different genome and set of reference annotations, you can install them as follows.

You'll need a reference genome (ie. my_genome.fasta) and reference transcript structure annotations (ie. my_annotations.gtf).  This GTF file should include 'exon' features and contain attributes for 'gene_id', 'transcript_id', and optionally but recommended 'gene_name' to preferentially use gene symbols.

Generate a specially formatted reference cDNA fasta file like so:

    util/gtf_file_to_cDNA_seqs.pl my_annotations.gtf my_genome.fasta > my_cdna.fasta

and then build an index for the my_cdna.fasta file like so:

    util/index_cdna_seqs.pl my_cdna.fasta


When running STAR-Fusion, specify '--ref_GTF my_annotations.gtf' and '--ref_cdna my_cdna.fasta' to make use of these alternative targets.
